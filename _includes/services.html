                      I started off programming in C and C++ and have still used both
                      for some recent projects (example in my portfolio).
                      I have a firm knowledge base of OOP concepts
                      and primarily I work in Java for projects now, but I'm enjoying exploring using
                      Kotlin too. All my general coding is done in the IntelliJ IDE.

                    <p class="text-muted">Android has been a personal keen interest of mine and area of study outside of work,
                      it is a key field I would like to pursue in my professional career. I have an interest in HCI
                      and design which is most likely why I enjoy it coupled together with programming.
                      All my android development is done in Android Studio, app design in Adobe XD, AI and PS</p>

                      give a presentation about Git and the platform I have done all my development using it for version control. This tool has
                      had a huge impact on how I like to work and look forward to
                   using this tool or similar tools more in the industry at a professional level and developing this skill further</p>
