                      it is a key field I would like to pursue in my professional career. I have an interest in HCI
                      and design which is most likely why I enjoy it. All my android development is done using Android Studio</p>

                      had a huge impact on how I like to work and look forward to
                   using this tool or similar tools more in the industry at a professional level and developing this skill further</p>
