                      Being a recent graduate, Iâ€™m looking for junior and entry level roles to match my ability, though
                      I am confident in myself to be an asset to the company I am working for as
                      I bring some key experience points already from previous employments.
                      <br><br>
                      Having gained an abundance of professional skills through not just education but previous employments too,
                      coupled together with great work ethics and interpersonal skills are driving me forward with
                      my pursuit of an active career in software development.
                      Already having a firm work mentality from being in a strict policy environment
                      and experience working in teams in DevOps environments
                      I bring the ability to manage my own work load and work in a team.
