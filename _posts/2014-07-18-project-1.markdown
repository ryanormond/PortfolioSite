description: As with previous Sussex Conversations, broadcasting and production of the event - which was streamed to a live web audience - was made possible by the University’s Media Technology Lab, offering invaluable live television production experience for some of Sussex’s undergraduates from the School of Engineering and Informatics, who formed part of the production crew. For myself this involved prep starting months prior as I was working for the university as well as being a student. Working in an exciting environment to produce a live show not just for the audience in the theatre but for others watching the live stream. Positions <br/> May 5 2017, Camera Operator & Set co-ordinator, Demockery and the media in a 'post factual' age. <br/> Apr 14 2016, Camera Operator & Set co-ordinator, The EU Referendum In or Out? <br/> Apr 18 2015, Camera Operator & Set co-ordinator, State of the nation - an election special. <br/> Apr 7 2014, Graphics, Power hungry, how can we sustain our energy needs?<br/>The programs can be watched at Sussex MTL on YouTube.
