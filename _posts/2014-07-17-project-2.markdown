description: Project was written in LUA for JustMacros scripts and C++ for the controller code, Git used for version control of project.<br/> The project entailed writing software to be run on a micro controller that would link via internal network to the studios server and receive commands over UDP to operate and control the soft light boxes around the studio. The gallery is running JustMacros where the LUA scripts written for the project can be found. The scripts are written in a way so that they can either be used<br/><br/> The exciting part of the project is the LUA scripts function can be passed an RGB value of any colour along with a frequency code for Pulse Width Modulation of the led's. This is done via a simple one line call E.G ledLightColourControl(red, green, blue, frequency), call scripts can be used and mapped to a macro pad in the gallery so at the push of a button the whole studio will change allowing for themes to be created for personalised presentations.<br/> The scripts then send off the command over UDP to the controller which assess the content, calculates the PWM value and reacts accordingly, the controller is constantly listening for commands and is connected via ethernet to the gallery server, this was done to avoid any network connection loss which can happen over wireless connection the command is also triple sent to eliminate any packet loss hiccups if any at all may happen.<br/>PWM or pulse duration modulation is essentially an imitation of an analog signal by turning the signal on and off in a pattern to simulate an steady voltage between 1-5v, used in LEDs for this project was essential as the studio used broadcasting cameras of varying types ranging from Sony EX3's to Blackmagic 4K cinema cameras. This variation meant that different frequency values provided different results for which cameras were in use e.g. lines could be seen on the light boxes as the PWM didn't match the frame rate the camera was working at.<br/><br/> Constructing the electronics and wiring it all up to support 24 lighting strips (3 chained) from each 24v pack and connected to the controller was another part of the project. This meant for meticulous testing and calculating of the current and power needed by the board. I worked on and constructed the electronics following the project managers schematic design and then alongside the lead technician to ensure the setup was to safety standards required by the university, this was in turn checked by the university inspector to be signed off. We then ran all the cables in the gallery and studio following the technician and the project managers layout and thoroughly tested all outlets and packs and provided a safety report of the full installation to the project manager.<br/><br/> A basic version of the project and mock script can be found on my Github, the full project is not available as it is on a private repo for confidentiality as required by the university.
