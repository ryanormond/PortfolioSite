description: Draper Lecture, Nov 2014 - Shami Chakrabarti - On Liberty and Alumni Law Networking <br/><br/>Sussex conversations, 2014 - 2017, London <br/><br/>Open day live streams 2014 - 2018, University of Sussex<br/><br/>A Dialogue, Sussex MTL in partnership with the Creative Arts department, MTL Youtube<br/><br/>The projects listed above are a small selection of notable projects but many more were worked on too as what I would be doing changed week by week or even day by day.<br/><br/>I worked on many different projects at the university in a very diverse role. One of the common projects allocated was filming and obtaining/creating content for the university from events or requests. Events were on and off campus events and required work solo and in teams, the projects involved collaborating and liaising with other persons involved with the events to ensure the best footage and result was obtained.<br/><br/>The projects involved ensuring all equipment was ready and operational along with sourcing new equipment if required and in some cases constructing bespoke rigs and component combination setups. Following shot requests and storyboards from the director or supervisor were required to be done to a perfect standard and done exactly as specified following commands and ques from the director through headsets, earpieces or from scripts given. I worked for a year before and then during my degree for the University of Sussex on different projects and as a general technician every week, this was a permanent Grade 4 position.
